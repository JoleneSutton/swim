Functions for **Spatial Weight Informed Mapping (SWIM)**, which enables integration of data from incongruent sources to generate a heterogeneous layer of sampling weights. Events missing geographic coordinates are assigned to a spatial grid using a probability-based framework informed by the sampling weights (i.e., sampling probabilities are proportional to assigned weights).

## Installation

You can install **SWIM** with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JoleneSutton/swim")
```
